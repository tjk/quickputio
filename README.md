# Quick Put.io

**This is a quick little hack / proof of concept. It could be somewhat
useful with minor improvements.**

## How to

```
% git clone git@github.com:tjk/quickputio.git
% cd quickputio
% bundle && ./quickputio
```

Then, navigate to `http://localhost:4567`, fill out the form, and see if
you get lucky.
